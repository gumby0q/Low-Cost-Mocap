# Create a list of images

# Create a Structure From Motion (SFM) object

# # Perform SFM reconstruction
# reconstruction, points3d = sfm.reconstruct(images)

# # Print the reconstructed 3D points
# print("Reconstructed 3D points:")
# for point in points3d:
#     print(point)

# Visualize the reconstructed scene (optional)
# You may need additional visualization code depending on your requirements
# For example, you could use matplotlib to plot the reconstructed 3D points

# Display images with key points (optional)
# You can use OpenCV's drawing functions to overlay key points on the images

# Display the result (optional)
# You can use OpenCV's imshow function to display the reconstructed scene or any other visualizations
